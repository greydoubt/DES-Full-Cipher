God is fucking dead. Not only dead but rotting. Humanity is a failed project of his that ended up being his own demise, we are now left to our own devices until the inevitable day humanity will destroy itself in its own fire and brimstone. Was this always inevitable? If you started the exact same universe in the same pattern one thousand times over would you get the same results? The Big Bang, creation of the Milky Way, the creation of earth, the late heavy bombardment, the evolution of life on earth, the Permian extinction, The rise of primates, human civilization, the Mongol invasions, the plague, the First World War, The Second World War, and all that follows up until now? Are we just tricked into believing we have free will? Are we just slaves to the inevitable? What is the point of all of thisâ€¦being forced into this cruel reality of ours?
