# DES-Full-Cipher

I took a PDF of a government specification and turned it into a full code implementation that can be used just by installing python -- do you want to encrypt your own files? hold your local business hostage? experiment with password cracking on a standard known to be "solvable"? The possibilities are endless!!!

How to use:

Install python 3 if necessary
Run: "python main.py" with a file named default.txt in the same directory as the script
This file will be encoded/decoded and the script outputs a file, output.txt
